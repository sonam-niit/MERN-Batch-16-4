useEffect Hook
-------------------------------------
used to handle side effects in the functional components.

Types of Side effects: data fetching, DOM manupulation,
checking the state updates.

Its very important while handling the life cycle of our component.

Accepts 2 parameters: 1: callback, 2: dependency

useEffect(callback,dependency)

---> if no dependency

	useEffect(callback)
	callback runs continously in the background

--> if you give [] as dependency then the side effect runs only once when the component loaded.
