State in React
-------------------
whenever the state get changed the value renders again.
Here the application is Single Page Application, virtual DOM to original dom

it will check is there changes then it will render only those changes rather that reloading the full Page.

how to work with the state?

use -- useState Hook

syntax: const [name,setName]= useState("Prathibha");

declare variable as array with 2values 
1. variable name
2. function name to change the value to that variable

useState hook you need to import from React...
it accpets a default value 

if I declare a number so I can set the default value as 0 too.
const [count,setCount]= useState(0);

for object i can set default value {}

const [user,setUser]= useState({});

for Array I can set the default value []

const [products,setProducts]= useState([]);
