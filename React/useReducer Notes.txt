UseReducer hook used to manage the more complex state which we are including into our components.

It is an alternative of useState hook,

when you want apply state logic which involves multiple sub states or when then next state depends in previous state then we should use useReducer hook.

How It works?
-----------------------
use useReducer Hook

which accepts 2 arguments 
1. current state
	:prev state of your perticular state which is declared
2. action: which executes and based on that create an updated state of the current state.

=========================================================================================
const reeducer= (state,action)=>{

	switch(action.type){

		case 'INCREMENT':
			return {count:state.count+1}

		case 'DECREMENT':
			return {count:state.count-1}

		default:
			return state;
		
	}
}

useReducer Hook for working with reducer function and state

const [state,dispatch]= useReducer(reducer,{count:0})

state: represting the current state
dispatch: its a function which sends actions to your reducer

how to use dispatch?

dispatch({type:'INCREMENT'})

Simply, the complex code of Redux can make easy to manage the state of your application using useReducer Hook
