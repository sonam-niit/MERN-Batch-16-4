Redux is the Librray which is used for the state Management.

Why Statemanagement?

Ecommerce Project
-----------------------
UserData to manage
CartData to manage
orders manage

userData and Cart data you wnat to showcase in your more than 1 component. we can use props

but for using throughout the application use the state management library called redux.

Redux Basically Works on 3 Things
---------------------------------------------------
Store, Reducer and Actions

Store: Its a strorage which stores all the states which we can use anywhere in our application.

	state: is readonly, whenver you wnat to make changes to your state, we need to dispach the action which helps to call the reducer to make the changes

Reducers: its function which accepts 2 parameters (action, current state of the application) it returns the updated instance of the state.

It will not chnage the any part of the state, its just making a new instance of the state with all required chnages.
