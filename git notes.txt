Git Working:
--------------------

Working copy:  my system code where I am working (my workspace, the folder where i am making changes)

staging Area:

	(local repo: where we add our content ad staging area)

before adding it to remote repo we can verify. If its ok then we will add them to Remote Repository.

Git Repository:

Repository which contains our code with proper versioning with all changes.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

from workspace -->  add in staging area --> local repository --> Remote Repository.

to complete this proces we have some set of git commands.

1. git init : this basically initialize git repo in your local folder.

2. git config: used to configure the user. to identify the user with its username or email id & password.

3. git add : to add certain files to staging area.
	     git add index.html (it will add index.html to staging area)

4. git commit : to add files from staging area to its local repo
		(this commiting the changes with its version and you can add a message as well)

5. git status: display the state of your working directory and staging area.

to work with the same we need to set up git to out local system and to upload to its remote repo we will create account to github.com

After installation of git if you are geeting an error like git is not recognized as an internal or external command then follow the below step to set an environment variable.

C:\Program Files\Git\bin  (copy this path)

right click on your pc --> properties --> advance system settings --> click on environment variable. --> click on path --> click on new --> paste copied path and click ok --> ok --> ok --> refresh system and check the version again.

================================================================================

to push code on git repo

step: create a folder named TestGit and add some files to that folder.

	open that folder in cmd 

	initialize git rep: git init

	
	to add files in staging area execute command
	> git add file-name (git add index.html)
	to check weather the added to its staging area or not
	>git status

	inf you want to add all files to the staging area then
	>git add . (it will add all files to staging area)

	add files from staging area to local repo
	>git commit -m "This is my Version1"

	to commit you files to some repository first config the user

	>git config --global user.email "sonam@gmail.com"

	(This command you need to execute only once not every time)

	Let's create a repository on my github.com

	Change branch from master to main
	>git branch -M main

	>git remote add origin https://github.com/sonam-niit/DemoRepo.git
	(to set origin so when you execute push command your files uploaded to this folder which you have created just now)

	>git push -u origin main
	(this is basically push your code which is commited to your remote repository)
	(for the very first time when you execute this command it will ask you for authentication select default authentication which is browsers authentication so it will pop up a git hub login in browser enter your correct emailid and password so once its authenticated, it will push all commited files from local repo to remote repository.

Here if I make any changes to this folder

>git add .
>git commit -m "message"
>git push -u origin main
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you work with the gitbash then just right click to any folder and open with git bash and you can execute same commands from git bash too.


========================================================================================
git pull command:

--> used to receive the data from git hub. It fetches and merges changes on the remote server to your working directory.

just go to your any repository in github.com and click on add readme file

commit the changes.

to get those changes to your locla system.

execute below command to your folder location.

>git pull

(it will pull readme.md file to your local system)


git log command: this will tell you the commit history.

>git log
you can pass number to see the latest commits.
>git log -3 (it will show you the latest 3 commits)

Git Branch
-----------------
show you all the branches available in the repository

Git Merge
---------------
this is used to merge branches

git merge main (merge the main)

Git stash command
----------------------------
built in command with distributed version control system

helping us to switch the branches.

i have create a repo with 2 branch backend and frontend

(half work done with backend and now i want to move to frontend branch) and i dont't want to commit.

It that case if you want to switch branches you can use git stash command.


It is basically providing a temp storage where we can keep our data safe without commiting.


Git Checkout
-------------------

allows you to move from one branch to another branch.

checking the branch updates when any commits happen.
