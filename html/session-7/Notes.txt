Flex Layout
------------------------------------
Flex box is trying to adjust the elements in one dimentional.

--- Layout which we can create using flex is flexible layout.

Property:

display: flex -- it will try to adjust all the elements in a single row.

flex-wrap: by default the value of fle-wrap is no wrap means it will adjust all the elements in one row. If you want to create multiple rows if the row completes then use value as wrap.

	wrap-reverse: will wrap in new row if required and then display elements in reverse order.
	(wrap meeans: if the row completed with elements then wrap the next elements in another row)
flex-direction:

	it desides how we want to display elements.
	the default value is row.
	if the value given as column: display the item vertically from top to bottom

	column-reverse--> display item vertically from bottom to top.

flex-flow:  if you want to combine flex-direction and flex-wrap together use flex-flow

		flex-flow: row wrap;

		first property value is for flex-direction & seond property value is for flex-wrap.

justify-content: used to align items in flex-container.

	flex-start: start from the flex start position
	flex-end: start from the end
	center: align elements in center
	space-around: give the space around an element
	space-evenly: distribute the space evenly in all elements
	space-between: give the space between elements.

align-items: helps to align flex-items properly.

Grid Layout
-----------------------------------

Here we can adjust our elements in 2 dimentions.
we can adjust out elements in the combination rows and columns.

to work layout use display as grid.

to adjust grid with rows and columns use

grid-template-column property and you can give the values seperated space acording to the no of columns you want in your grid.

to give the gaps from both rows and columns use gap propery

row-gap==> give gaps between rows
column-gap==> give the gaps between columns.

Grid Area
------------------------------
basically specifying  a name to the grid item
 that we can use as reference in a grid container
