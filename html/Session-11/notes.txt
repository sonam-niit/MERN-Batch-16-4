let and const keyword having a block scope means you can access then till its block where it is declared.

{
	let y=20;
	//this variable accessible here only
}

can't use outside of that block.

Var keyword is having a function scope means if a variable declared like as below.

function test(){

	if(){
		var x=20;
	}

	//here I can access that x variable 
}

const is constant once the value assigned we can not change it.

Loops: iterative statements.

if you want to execute same thing multiple times better we should use loop.

3 types of loops available.

1. while loop
2. do while loop
3. for loop.


While Loop
----------------------------------------------

while(condition)
{
	//statements
}

check the condition, if the condition is true i will execute the statements.


do while loop
-----------------------
do{
	//write statements to execute
}while(condition);

it will execute do statements first then chekc the condition so if the condition true then again it will continue with do.

here, the loop execute atleast one time wether the condition is true or false thats why these loop is called as Exit control loop.


where as while loop is checking condition at first, if condition true then only it proceed otherwise it terminates. thats why it is called Entry Control loop.

Tasks

1. WAP to print your name 5 times with number
	
	o/p:

		1: Sonam Soni
		2: Sonam Soni
		3: Sonam Soni
		4: Sonam Soni
		5: Sonam Soni


2. WAP to print first 50 natural numbers in browser as well as in console.
		o/p 1
		    2
		    3
		    ................................
		    50

3. WAP to print first 50 odd numbers
	o/p
		1
		3
		5
		7
		....................
		99

4. WAP to print first 50 even numbers
	o/p
		2
		4
		6
		8
		....................
		100

All the above programs execute with both while loop and do while loop.


For loop
--------------------------------------------
Popular loop while working with some Arrays.

this loop accepts 3 parameters sepearted by semicolon.

para1: initialization
para2: condition
para3: increment/decrement.


for(let i=1; i<=10; i++){
	//set of statements for iteration
}

all this para executes everytime? no first initialization execute only once when the loop starts.
where condition and increment will execute everytime.

as per above loop
i=1 initialized

check condition 1<=10 true print 1 increment i by 1 (i=2)
check condition 2<=10 true print 2 increment i by 1 (i=3)
check condition 3<=10 true print 3 increment i by 1 (i=4)
.
.
.
.
check condition 9<=10 true print 9 increment i by 1 (i=10)
check condition 10<=10 true print 10 increment i by 1 (i=11)
check condition 11<=10 false loop terminated.


this loop also condition checks first so it is also called as exit control loop.
