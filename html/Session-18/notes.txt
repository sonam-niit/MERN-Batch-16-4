OOPS
------

object oriented programming structure (approach)

focus on object and create your codes.

main pillers of oops
---------------------

1.class
2.object
3.inheritance
4.polymorphism
5.abstyraction
6.encaptulation
-------------------------------------------------------

ES5 - ecmascriot 5 which is not using oops approach means its more focusing on functional programming, functions based program.

we can combine our functions as part of class and we can use it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
class: its a design/ template/ blue print of a object from than we can create multiple objects as per the requirements.

So, sometimes its also called as class is the collection of objects.

to create a class use class key word and then give class name( you can give any Name but follow the naming convententions)

inside the class we are declaring member variables and member functions.

always we will use this keyword to access member variables and member functions in a class.

--> to initialize the values of variable we are using constructor assign values.
