To remember the user we can use Cookies which stores values in browser storage
-------------------------------------------------
to work with cookies use package cookie-parser.

include in index.js

app.use(cookieparser());

Here we are trying to make our all routes protected, so if user logged in then only user can access other routes, other wise we will ask the user to login first.

Created model: user_model.js

Created routes: register, login & profile

In Login: if user logged In successfully Then add cookie in response
		res.cookie("key","value"); //you can see the cookie in browser or in postman as well

To read the cookies if user try to access profile page then
		req.cookies.key (cookie key you can give here)
		(to read the cookie cookie-parser required, if you forgot to add that it may cause error)

create main server: index.js

localhost:5000/api/auth/register

localhost:5000/api/auth/login

	(after login you can see the cookie generated in your postman)

localhost:5000/api/auth/profile

	(it will allow you to access profile )

localhost:5000/api/auth/logout

	(it will remove the added cookie)
