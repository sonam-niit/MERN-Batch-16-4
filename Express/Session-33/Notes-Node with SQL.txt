To use node with any SQL DB we can use Sequelize package which is an ORM tool.

create package.json file: npm init -y

>npm i express sequelize mysql2

(install this 3 packages to set up REST API with DB)

create server.js
--------------------------
basic express server code.

to setup sequlize and model: create one folder called model inside that create file user_model.js

set up the model and make sure you export to use it in another file.

--> create routes in 

	folder: routes
	file: user_routes.js

	set up the all crud operations.

use this route file in express server

by adding app.use command.
